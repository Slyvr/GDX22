Theme: DYSTOPIAN CHRISTMAS

Ideas:
- Automation game where enslaved elves make toys
- Text based choose your own adventure
- RPG - children cross the wasteland to get to santa's workshop
	- santa is evil, kill him and the elves to get the xmas gift pile
- Fighting game - santa, elf, rudolf
- Papers, please - but retail worker during xmas season
- Post apocalypse side scroller with santa dropping presents down chimneys into destroyed houses to fix them
- Cookie clicker game where an evil santa grinds elves/reindeer/unicorns into magic guts that get automated into bad/ok/good presents
